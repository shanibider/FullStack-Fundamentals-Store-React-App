    console.log (expense);

    // takes the previous state (prevExpense) and returns a new array that includes the new expense at the beginning.

// Renders JSX code 

// Renders the NewExpense component and passes the 'addExpenseHandler' function as a prop named 'onAddExpense'. This allows the NewExpense component to notify the App component when a new expense is added.
// In the NewExpense component, i would use the 'onAddExpense' prop to notify the parent (App) component when a new expense is added. This is typically done by calling the onAddExpense function with the new expense data.

// Renders the Expenses component, passing the expenses state as  as a prop named 'items'.  This allows the Expenses component to access and display the list of expenses.

  return <div>
    <h2> This is my store!ðŸ˜Š</h2>
    {/* Passing addExpenseHandler to NewExpense Component */}
    <NewExpense onAddExpense = { addExpenseHandler} />
    <Expenses items={expenses} />
  </div>
}

export default App;









/* Passing addExpenseHandler to NewExpense Component:

return (<NewExpense onAddExpense={addExpenseHandler} />)

And inn the NewExpense component, i would use the onAddExpense prop to notify the parent (App) component when a new expense is added. 
For example, in the NewExpense component:

const NewExpense = (props) => {
    ... 
    props.onAddExpense (enteredExpenseData);
  };
};
